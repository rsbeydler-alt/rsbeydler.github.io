	abstract = {Tremor, a common and often primary symptom of Parkinson’s disease, has been modeled with distinct onset and maintenance dynamics. To identify the neurophysiologic correlates of each state, we acquired intraoperative cortical and subthalamic nucleus recordings from ten (9M, 1F) patients performing a naturalistic visual-motor task. From this task we isolated short epochs of tremor onset and sustained tremor. Comparing these epochs, we found that the subthalamic nucleus was central to tremor onset, as it drove both motor cortical activity and tremor output. Once tremor became sustained, control of tremor shifted to cortex. At the same time, changes in directed functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex further distinguished the sustained tremor state.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:
Tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). While tremor pathophysiology is thought to involve both basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamic-cortical circuits, it is unknown how these structures functionally interact to produce tremor. In this manuscript, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex in patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Using an intraoperative task, we examined tremor in two separate dynamic contexts: when tremor first emerged, and when tremor was sustained. We believe that these findings reconcile several models of Parkinson’s tremor, while describing the short-timescale dynamics of subcortical-cortical interactions during tremor for the first time. These findings may describe a framework for developing proactive and responsive neurostimulation models for specifically treating tremor.},

	abstract = {Objective: Identifying neural activity biomarkers of brain disease is essential to provide objective estimates of disease burden, obtain reliable feedback regarding therapeutic efficacy, and potentially to serve as a source of control for closed-loop neuromodulation. In Parkinson's Disease (PD), microelectrode recordings (MER) are routinely performed in the basal ganglia to guide electrode implantation for deep brain stimulation (DBS). While pathologically-excessive oscillatory activity has been observed and linked to PD motor dysfunction broadly, the extent to which these signals provide quantitative information about disease expression and fluctuations, particularly at short timescales, is unknown. Furthermore, the degree to which informative signal features are similar or different across patients has not been rigorously investigated. We sought to determine the extent to which motor error in PD across patients can be decoded on a rapid timescale using spectral features of neural activity. Approach: Here, we recorded neural activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of subjects with PD undergoing awake DBS surgery while they performed an objective, continuous behavioral assessment that synthesized heterogenous PD motor manifestations to generate a scalar measure of motor dysfunction at short timescales. We then leveraged natural motor performance variations as a “ground truth” to identify corresponding neurophysiological biomarkers. Main Results: Support vector machines using multi-spectral decoding of neural signals from the STN succeeded in tracking the degree of motor impairment at short timescales (as short as one second). Spectral power across a wide range of frequencies, beyond the classic “β” oscillations, contributed to this decoding, and multi-spectral models consistently outperformed those generated using more isolated frequency bands. While generalized decoding models derived across subjects were able to estimate motor impairment, patient-specific models typically performed better. Significance: These results demonstrate that quantitative information about short-timescale PD motor dysfunction is available in STN neural activity, distributed across various patient-specific spectral components, such that an individualized approach will be critical to fully harness this information for optimal disease tracking and closed-loop neuromodulation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive movement disorder characterized by heterogenous motor dysfunction with fluctuations in severity. Objective, short-timescale characterization of these symptoms is necessary as therapies become increasingly adaptive. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize a novel, naturalistic, and goal-directed tablet-based task and complementary analysis protocol designed to characterize the features of PD. METHODS: A total of 26 patients with PD and without deep brain stimulation (DBS), 20 control subjects, and eight patients with PD and with deep brain stimulation (DBS) completed the task. Eight metrics, each designed to capture an aspect of motor dysfunction in PD, were calculated from 1-second, non-overlapping epochs of the raw positional and pressure data. These metrics were used to generate a classifier to produce a unifying, scalar ‘motor error score' (MES). These data were compared to standard clinical assessments of these same patients. Additionally, these data were compared to analogous data generated from a group of 12 patients with essential tremor (ET) to assess the task's specificity for PD. Finally, a classifier was generated to differentiate between motor dysfunction in patients with PD with DBS in different stimulation states. RESULTS: The eight metrics calculated from the raw positional and force data captured during task completion were non-redundant. MES generated by the SVM analysis protocol showed a strong correlation with MDS-UPDRS-III scores assigned by movement disorder specialists. Analysis of the relative contributions of each of the eight metrics showed a significant difference between the motor dysfunction of PD and ET. Much of this difference was attributable to the homogenous, tremor-dominant phenotype of ET motor dysfunction. Finally, in individual patients with PD with DBS, task performance and subsequent SVM classification effectively differentiated between the ‘DBSOn' and ‘DBSOff' stimulation states. CONCLUSION: The tablet-based task correlated strongly with the MDS-UPDRS-III. Additionally, the task showed specificity for PD when compared to ET, another common movement disorder. Finally, the task was able to distinguish between the ‘DBSOn' and ‘DBSOff' states within single patients with PD. This task provides temporally-precise and specific information about motor dysfunction in two movement disorders that could feasibly correlate to neural activity.},

Final DBS electrode coordinates for 3 patient populations (ventral intermediate nucleus [VIM], subthalamic nucleus [STN], and globus pallidus pars interna [GPi]) were calculated.

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to dysfunction in multiple cortico-striatal circuits. The neurodegeneration has also been associated with impaired white matter integrity. This structural and functional “disconnection” in PD needs further characterization. We investigated the structural and functional organization of the PD whole brain connectome consisting of 200 nodes using diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI, respectively. Data from 20 non-demented PD patients on dopaminergic medication and 20 matched controls were analyzed using graph theory-based methods. We focused on node strength, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency as measures of local network properties; and network modularity as a measure of information flow. PD patients showed reduced white matter connectivity in frontoparietal-striatal nodes compared to controls, but no change in modular organization of the white matter tracts. PD group also showed reduction in functional local network metrics in many nodes distributed across the connectome. There was also decreased functional modularity in the core cognitive networks including the default mode and dorsal attention networks, and sensorimotor network, as well as a lack of modular distinction in the orbitofrontal and basal ganglia nodes in the PD group compared to controls. Our results suggest that despite subtle white matter connectivity changes, the overall structural organization of the PD connectome remains robust at relatively early disease stages. However, there is a breakdown in the functional modular organization of the PD connectome.},

	abstract = {To adapt successfully to our environments, we must use the outcomes of our choices to guide future behavior. Critically, we must be able to correctly assign credit for any particular outcome to the causal features which preceded it. In some cases, the causal features may be immediately evident, whereas in others they may be separated in time or intermingled with irrelevant environmental stimuli, creating a potentially nontrivial credit-assignment problem. We examined the neuronal representation of information relevant for credit assignment in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) of two male rhesus macaques performing a task that elicited key aspects of this problem. We found that neurons conveyed the information necessary for credit assignment. Specifically, neuronal activity reflected both the relevant cues and outcomes at the time of feedback and did so in a manner that was stable over time, in contrast to prior reports of representational instability in the dlPFC. Furthermore, these representations were most stable early in learning, when credit assignment was most needed. When the same features were not needed for credit assignment, these neuronal representations were much weaker or absent. These results demonstrate that the activity of dlPFC neurons conforms to the basic requirements of a system that performs credit assignment, and that spiking activity can serve as a stable mechanism that links causes and effects.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Credit assignment is the process by which we infer the causes of our successes and failures. We found that neuronal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex conveyed the necessary information for performing credit assignment. Importantly, while there are various potential mechanisms to retain a “trace” of the causal events over time, we observed that spiking activity was sufficiently stable to act as the link between causes and effects, in contrast to prior reports that suggested spiking representations were unstable over time. In addition, we observed that this stability varied as a function of learning, such that the neural code was more reliable over time during early learning, when it was most needed.},

	abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease have difficulties with self-initiating a task and maintaining a steady task performance. We hypothesized that these difficulties relate to reorganization in the sensorimotor execution, cingulo-opercular task-set maintenance, and frontoparietal adaptive control networks. We tested this hypothesis using graph theory-based network analysis of a composite network including a total of 86 nodes, derived from the three networks of interest. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were collected from 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (age 42–75 years, 11 females; Hoehn and Yahr score 2–3, average 2.4 ± 0.4) in their off-medication state and 30 matched control subjects (age 44–75 years, 10 females). For each node, we calculated strength as a general measure of connectivity, global efficiency and betweenness centrality as measures of functional integration, and clustering coefficient and local efficiency as measures of functional segregation. We found reduced node strength, clustering, and local efficiency in sensorimotor and posterior temporal nodes. There was also reduced node strength and betweenness centrality in the dorsal anterior insula and temporoparietal junction nodes of the cingulo-opercular network. These nodes are involved in integrating multimodal information, specifically related to self-awareness, sense of agency, and ultimately to intact perception of self-in-action. Moreover, we observed significant correlations between global disease severity and averaged graph metrics of the whole network. In addition to the well-known task-related frontostriatal mechanisms, we propose that the resting-state reorganization in the composite network can contribute to problems with self-initiation and task-set maintenance in Parkinson's disease.},

Lesions of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule by other techniques have been shown to be efficacious in prior studies.A total of 7 of the 9 patients were considered full responders (77.8\%; Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale change ≥35\%). Adverse effects included transient apathy/amotivation postsurgery (2 patients). One patient had a small tract hemorrhage where the laser fiber traversed the cerebral cortex as well as persistent insomnia postsurgery. One individual died after a drug overdose 7 mo postsurgery, which was judged unrelated to the surgery.LITT ventral capsulotomy was generally well tolerated, with promising evidence of effectiveness in the largest such series to date. Results were comparable to those after gamma knife ventral capsulotomy, as well as ventral anterior limb deep brain stimulation.},

	abstract = {Objective Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is typically performed with one trajectory to target the medial temporal lobe (MTL). MTL structures such as piriform and entorhinal cortex are epileptogenic, but due to their relative geometry, they are difficult to target with one trajectory while simultaneously maintaining adequate ablation of the amygdala and hippocampus. We hypothesized that a two-trajectory approach could improve ablation of all relevant MTL structures. First, we created large-scale computer simulations to compare idealized one- vs two-trajectory approaches. A two-trajectory approach was then validated in an initial cohort of patients. Methods We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to create subject-specific target structures consisting of hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform/entorhinal/perirhinal cortex. An algorithm searched for safe potential trajectories along the hippocampal axis (catheter one) and along the amygdala-piriform axis (catheter two) and compared this to a single trajectory optimized over all structures. The proportion of each structure ablated at various burn radii was evaluated. A cohort of 11 consecutive patients with mTLE received two-trajectory LITT; demographic, operative, and outcome data were collected. Results The two-trajectory approach was superior to the one-trajectory approach at nearly all burn radii for all hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei (p {\textless} .05). Two-laser trajectories achieved full ablation of MTL cortical structures at physiologically realistic burn radii, whereas one-laser trajectories could not. Five patients with at least 1 year of follow-up (mean = 21.8 months) experienced Engel class I outcomes; 6 patients with less than 1 year of follow-up (mean = 6.6 months) are on track for Engel class I outcomes. Significance Our anatomic analyses and initial clinical results suggest that LITT amygdalohippocampotomy performed via two-laser trajectories may promote excellent seizure outcomes. Future studies are required to validate the long-term clinical efficacy and safety of this approach.},

        bio
Tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). While tremor pathophysiology is thought to involve both basal ganglia and cerebello-thalamic-cortical circuits, it is unknown how these structures functionally interact to produce tremor. In this manuscript, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex in patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Using an intraoperative task, we examined tremor in two separate dynamic contexts: when tremor first emerged, and when tremor was sustained. We believe that these findings reconcile several models of Parkinson's tremor, while describing the short-timescale dynamics of subcortical-cortical interactions during tremor for the first time. These findings may describe a framework for developing proactive and responsive neurostimulation models for specifically treating tremor.},

	abstract = {MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy has been shown to be an effective treatment for medication refractory essential tremor. Here, we report a clinical-radiological analysis of 123 cases of MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy, and explore the relationships between treatment parameters, lesion characteristics and outcomes.All patients undergoing focused ultrasound thalamotomy by a single surgeon were included. The procedure was performed as previously described, and patients were followed for up to 1 year. MRI was performed 24 h post-treatment, and lesion locations and volumes were calculated.We retrospectively evaluated 118 essential tremor patients and five tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease patients who underwent thalamotomy. At 24 h post-procedure, tremor abated completely in the treated hand in 81 essential tremor patients. Imbalance, sensory disturbances and dysarthria were the most frequent acute adverse events. Patients with any adverse event had significantly larger lesions, while inferolateral lesion margins were associated with a higher incidence of motor-related adverse events. Twenty-three lesions were identified with irregular tails, often extending into the internal capsule; 22 of these patients experienced at least one adverse event.Treatment parameters and lesion characteristics changed with increasing surgeon experience. In later cases, treatments used higher maximum power (normalized to skull density ratio), accelerated more quickly to high power, and delivered energy over fewer sonications.Larger lesions were correlated with a rapid rise in both power delivery and temperature, while increased oedema was associated with rapid rise in temperature and the maximum power delivered. Total energy and total power did not significantly affect lesion size. A support vector regression was trained to predict lesion size and confirmed the most valuable predictors of increased lesion size as higher maximum power, rapid rise to high-power delivery, and rapid rise to high tissue temperatures. These findings may relate to a decrease in the energy efficiency of the treatment, potentially due to changes in acoustic properties of skull and tissue at higher powers and temperatures.We report the largest single surgeon series of focused ultrasound thalamotomy to date, demonstrating tremor relief and adverse events consistent with reported literature. Lesion location and volume impacted adverse events, and an irregular lesion tail was strongly associated with adverse events. High-power delivery early in the treatment course, rapid temperature rise, and maximum power were dominant predictors of lesion volume, while total power, total energy, maximum energy and maximum temperature did not improve prediction of lesion volume. These findings have critical implications for treatment planning in future patients.},

	abstract = {Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with gait and visuomotor abnormalities, but it is not clear where PD patients look during ambulation. Objective We sought to characterize the visual areas of interest explored by PD patients, with and without freezing of gait (FOG), compared to healthy volunteers (HVs). Methods Using an eye-tracking device, we compared visual fixation patterns in 17 HVs and 18 PD patients, with and without FOG, during an ambulatory and a nonambulatory, computer-based task. Results During ambulation, PD patients with FOG fixated more on proximal areas of the ground and less on the target destination. PD patients without FOG displayed a fixation pattern more similar to that of HVs. Similar patterns were observed during the nonambulatory, computer-based task. Conclusions Our findings suggest increased dependence on visual feedback from nearby areas in the environment in PD patients with FOG, even in the absence of motor demands. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},
