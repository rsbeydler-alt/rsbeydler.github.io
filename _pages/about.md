## About Me

I am a seventh-year MD/PhD candidate with the Department of Neuroscience and Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
Before Brown, I was a postbaccalaureate IRTA research fellow in the [Human Motor Control Section](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/mark-hallett) at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

My research with [Dr. Wael Asaad](https://www.brown.edu/Research/asaad/) works to define the functional and anatomical circuitry of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms.
In parallel, I am developing machine-learning approaches to optimize deep brain stimulation to selectively treat individual motor symptoms.
To accomplish this I combine intraoperative behavioral tasks, intracranial neurophysiology, real-time closed-loop stimulation, and clinical neuroimaging.

Upon completing my medical school training in May 2023, I plan on undergoing residency training in psychiatry to bridge my circuit-based neuromodulation approach to affective and cognitive disorders.
