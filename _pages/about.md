## About Me
I am currently a research-track psychiatry resident at the University of Pennsylvania.
With Drs. [Katherine Scangos](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9682519) and [Casey Halpern](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2009396), I am investigating how OCD-related alterations in approach-avoidance behavior can be restored with interventions such as deep brain stimulation and focused ultrasound.

At Brown my graduate research with [Dr. Wael Asaad](https://www.brown.edu/Research/asaad/) worked to define the functional and anatomical circuitry of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms.
I also developed machine-learning approaches to optimize deep brain stimulation to selectively treat individual motor symptoms.
To accomplish this I combined intraoperative behavioral tasks, intracranial neurophysiology, real-time closed-loop stimulation, and clinical neuroimaging.

Before all this, I was a postbaccalaureate IRTA research fellow in the [Human Motor Control Section](https://irp.nih.gov/catalyst/22/4/human-motor-control) at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
